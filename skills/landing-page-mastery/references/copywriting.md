# Copywriting Frameworks & Formulas

## The Conversion Equation

```
Conversion = (Desire × Clarity) / (Effort + Confusion)
```

To maximize conversion:
- ↑ Increase Desire (emotional benefits, aspirational outcomes)
- ↑ Increase Clarity (simple language, specific numbers)
- ↓ Reduce Effort (fewer fields, simpler CTAs)
- ↓ Reduce Confusion (one message, one action)

## Headline Formulas

### 1. Specific Outcome Formula
```
[Action verb] + [Specific outcome] + [Timeframe/Ease]
```

**Examples:**
- "Generate Invoices in 30 Seconds"
- "Write Emails That Get Replies in 5 Minutes"
- "Launch Your Course This Weekend"

❌ Bad: "The Best Invoicing Software" (vague, no outcome)
✅ Good: "Create Professional Invoices in Seconds, Not Hours"

### 2. Pain-Agitate Formula
```
[Pain point] + [Consequence] + [Implied solution]
```

**Examples:**
- "Stop Losing Sales to Slow Follow-ups"
- "Tired of Spreadsheets That Break Every Month?"
- "Your SaaS Website Is Costing You Customers"

### 3. Social Proof Headline
```
[Number] + [Audience] + [Result/Action]
```

**Examples:**
- "10,000+ Founders Use This to Save 10 Hours/Week"
- "Join 50,000 Marketers Getting Results"

### 4. Curiosity Gap Formula
```
[Unexpected claim] + [Specific context]
```

**Examples:**
- "The Counter-Intuitive Way Top Sellers Close Deals"
- "Why 'Free Trials' Are Killing Your Conversions"

## PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

Best for: Problem section, email sequences, ad copy

### Structure:

**P - Problem:** Name the problem clearly
**A - Agitate:** Make the pain feel worse (consequences, emotions)
**S - Solution:** Introduce your product as relief

### Example:

```
PROBLEM:
"You're spending 10+ hours/week on manual invoicing."

AGITATE:
"That's 500+ hours a year you could spend growing your business. 
Every hour wasted is a client you didn't land, a feature you didn't ship.
Meanwhile, your competitors are automating everything."

SOLUTION:
"Invoicely generates professional invoices in 30 seconds. 
Paste client details, select a template, send. Done."
```

### Anti-Pattern:
Don't agitate too much—you want urgency, not hopelessness.

## AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

Best for: Full-page narrative flow, long-form sales pages

### Structure:

**A - Attention:** Hook with headline/hero
**I - Interest:** Build curiosity with benefits/story
**D - Desire:** Create emotional want with proof/results
**A - Action:** Clear CTA with reduced friction

### Page Section Mapping:

| AIDA Stage | Landing Page Section |
|------------|---------------------|
| Attention | Hero (headline + visual) |
| Interest | Problem + How it works |
| Desire | Testimonials + Results |
| Action | CTA + Risk reversal |

---

## BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)

Best for: Short copy, email subject lines, ad hooks

### Structure:

**Before:** Current painful state
**After:** Desired transformed state
**Bridge:** Your product is the bridge

### Example:

```
BEFORE: "Drowning in customer support tickets"
AFTER: "Inbox zero every day, customers happy"
BRIDGE: "AutoReply AI handles 80% of tickets automatically"
```

## Feature → Benefit Translation

Never list features alone. Always translate to benefits.

### Formula:
```
[Feature] → "Which means..." → [Benefit] → "So you can..." → [Outcome]
```

### Examples:

| Feature | Benefit | Outcome |
|---------|---------|---------|
| AI-powered suggestions | Get better results without thinking | Close more deals |
| One-click export | Save hours on reporting | Have time for strategy |
| Real-time sync | Always up to date | Never miss important changes |
| Mobile app | Work from anywhere | Stay productive on the go |

---

## CTA Copy Formulas

### 1. Personalized Action
```
"Get My [Benefit]" > "Get [Benefit]" > "Submit"
```

**Examples:**
- "Get My Free Audit" (202% better than "Submit")
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Build My Landing Page"

### 2. Outcome-Focused
```
"[Action] + [Outcome]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Start Saving Time"
- "Launch Your Course"
- "Double My Conversions"

### 3. Low-Commitment
For cold traffic, reduce perceived commitment:

**Examples:**
- "Try Free for 14 Days"
- "See It in Action"
- "Watch 2-Min Demo"

### 4. Objection Handler (Sub-CTA Text)
Always add micro-copy under CTA buttons:

**Examples:**
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "Setup takes 2 minutes"
- "30-day money-back guarantee"

## Testimonial Formats

### 1. STAR Format (Best for results)
```
SITUATION: "Before, we were..."
TASK: "We needed to..."
ACTION: "We used [Product] to..."
RESULT: "Now we [specific metric]"
```

### 2. Quick Quote Format
```
"[Specific result or emotion]"
— [Full Name], [Title at Company]
```

**Example:**
```
"Cut our onboarding time from 2 weeks to 2 days."
— Sarah Chen, Head of Customer Success at Acme Inc.
```

### 3. Screenshot Format
Screenshot of tweet/LinkedIn post with:
- Real name and photo visible
- Company/role visible
- Specific praise (not generic)

## Anti-Marketing Copy (2026 Trend)

Users detect "salesy" copy instantly. Counter with authenticity:

### Principles:
1. Admit limitations ("We're not for everyone")
2. Be specific ("We respond in 5 minutes because we also hate waiting")
3. Sound human ("Built this because I was frustrated too")
4. Avoid buzzwords ("Revolutionary", "Game-changing", "Unlock potential")

### Example:

❌ Generic: "The best customer support platform"
✅ Anti-marketing: "Support software that doesn't make you want to throw your laptop. Most tickets resolved in under 5 minutes."

## Copy Length Guidelines

| Element | Optimal Length |
|---------|---------------|
| H1 Headline | 6-12 words |
| H2 Subheadline | 15-25 words |
| CTA Button | 2-5 words |
| Feature description | 1-2 sentences |
| Testimonial | 20-40 words |
| FAQ answer | 2-4 sentences |

## Voice of Customer (VoC) Mining

The best copy comes from customer language, not your imagination.

### Where to find VoC:
1. G2/Capterra reviews of competitors
2. Reddit threads about the problem
3. Support tickets and chat logs
4. Customer interview transcripts
5. Amazon reviews of related books

### What to extract:
- Exact phrases describing pain
- Words used to describe desired outcomes
- Common objections/fears
- Emotional language (frustration, relief, excitement)
